domain setup
set up a test domain devops.xpayback.in on the ubuntu server using below stack LAMP and LEMP

-> My task was to create a test domain called devops.xpayback.in using LEMP and LAMP.
-> first i started with LEMP.
   LAMP == Linux,apache2,mysql,php
-> I tried to work on LEMP i used website like digital ocean to install LAMP and to perform the operation i used Ubunt server.
-> along with installing LAMP i learnt what is the use of 
        > Web server?
	 A web server is a software application or hardware device that stores, processes, and serves website content to users over the Internet.
	types of webserver. 
	Common web server software includes Apache, Nginx, Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), and others. These servers can run on 	various operating 	systems such as Linux, Windows, or macOS. 
	
	> Learn the working of DNS, what are the types of DNS records?
	 DNS, or Domain Name System, is a fundamental part of the internet that translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses.
	A (Address) Record:
	AAAA (IPv6 Address) Record:
	CNAME (Canonical Name) Record:
	NS (Name Server) Record: etc
	
	>Learn what is registrar and how can we find out a domain's registrar?
	A domain registrar is a company or organization that manages the reservation and registration of domain names on the internet.
	When you register a domain name, you essentially lease the rights to use that specific domain for a set period (usually annually). The registrar helps you  	secure 	the domain, provides DNS services, and ensures that the domain registration information is accurate and up-to-date.
	> to find registrar:
	WHOIS Lookup:
	Registrar's Website:
	WHOIS Command in Terminal/Command Prompt:
	If you have access to a command line interface, you can use the WHOIS command to look up information about a domain. Open the terminal or command prompt and 	type:
	cmd === "whois domain.com"
	Replace "domain.com" with the actual domain you want to look up

	> What is host file and what's the need for it
	The "hosts" file is a plain text file on a computer that maps hostnames to IP addresses.
	Here's how it works:

	Name Resolution:
	When you enter a domain name (e.g., www.example.com) into your web browser, the computer needs to convert that domain name into an IP address to locate the 	server on the internet.
	DNS Lookup:
	Normally, your computer performs a Domain Name System (DNS) lookup to find the IP address associated with the domain. It sends a request to a DNS server, which 	then provides the IP address.
	Hosts File:
	The hosts file allows you to manually specify IP address and hostname mappings locally on your computer. When you try to access a domain, your computer first 	checks its hosts file before querying external DNS servers.

-> after compliting LAMP i started working on LEMP. and i used digital ocean website to install LEMP
-> then after this i started working on securing my website that is from http to https.
-> i used certbot to perform this operation. certboat will provide us ssl certificate for our website..we have to use godady or any other website to register our host.
-> We can use online tools to verify SSL status
-> then i started working on wordpress.
-> wordpress is used to make ur website visible globally and it can also be used to edit your websit and to perform different operations.
->inorder to work with wordpress i learnt the use of mysql and php and how we can configure mysql, and to create a databse, etc.

-> check what is CDN and it's use?
